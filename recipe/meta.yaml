  summary: Python promises
  description: |
    This is a special implementation of promises in that it can be used both
    for promise of a value and lazy evaluation. The biggest upside for this
    is that everything in a promise can also be a promise, e.g. filters,
    callbacks and errbacks can all be promises.
